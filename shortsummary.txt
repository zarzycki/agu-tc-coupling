This paper highlights the sensitivity of simulated tropical cyclone climatology to the choice of ocean coupling grid in high resolution climate simulations. When computations of atmosphere/ocean interactions are carried out on the coarser grid in the system, key quantities such as surface wind drag and heat fluxes are poorly represented. In the case of a coarser ocean grid, significantly stronger cyclone winds result, due to misaligned frictional vectors in the atmospheric dynamical core.
