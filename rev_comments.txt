While we use an observed tropical cyclone for analysis here, we emphasize that the goal is not to compare which configuration in this particular case performed better for this individual forecast. First, forecasts of individual cyclones show significant spread, owing to minute differences in initialization and model configuration. Secondly, there are far more components within CAM that contribute to the dynamical aspects of tropical cyclone maintenance. While we have isolated the impact of ocean coupling by only modifying that particular aspect of the simulation (while holding the remainder of the setup fixed), we have not performed a comprehensive analysis as to how other aspects of the configuration may impact forecast skill (e.g., convection or boundary layer parameterizations, numerical diffusion, etc.).
