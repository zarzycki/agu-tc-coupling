@article{TCVitals,
	Abstract = {AbstractThis study analyzes the Tropical Cyclone Vitals Database (TCVitals), which contains cyclone location, intensity, and structure information, generated in real time by forecasters. These data are used to initialize cyclones in several NCEP operational forecasting models via bogusing and vortex relocation methods. In many situations, time is of the essence and the TCVitals database represents the best real-time estimate of the cyclone state possible in real time, given the limitations of available data and time constraints inherent in real-time forecasting. NCEP and other users of TCVitals have a responsibility to work around the inevitable limitations of what forecasters can do for TCVitals in real time. With ensemble systems becoming available, a way to do that will soon be available. However, the TCVitals? limitations must first be quantitatively understood so that model developers can take them into account. That is the motivation for the present study, which compares the TCVitals storm location and intensity to postseason reanalysis values found in the best-track database and statistically compares the TCVitals storm depth to 946 Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) overpasses. All storms of tropical depression strength or stronger in all basins are analyzed, with a special focus on National Hurricane Center TCVitals for the North Atlantic and eastern Pacific basins, the main areas of responsibility for NCEP. In addition, the sensitivity to TCVitals on the Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting (HWRF) model is examined by rerunning the 2011 HWRF for the 2010 North Atlantic season twice: once with TCVitals input and once with best-track input.},

@article{Golaz2002CLUBB,
	Abstract = {Abstract A new cloudy boundary layer single-column model is presented. It is designed to be flexible enough to represent a variety of cloudiness regimes?such as cumulus, stratocumulus, and clear regimes?without the need for case-specific adjustments. The methodology behind the model is the so-called assumed probability density function (PDF) method. The parameterization differs from higher-order closure or mass-flux schemes in that it achieves closure by the use of a relatively sophisticated joint PDF of vertical velocity, temperature, and moisture. A family of PDFs is chosen that is flexible enough to represent various cloudiness regimes. A double Gaussian family proposed by previous works is used. Predictive equations for grid box means and a number of higher-order turbulent moments are advanced in time. These moments are in turn used to select a particular member from the family of PDFs, for each time step and grid box. Once a PDF member has been selected, the scheme integrates over the PDF to close higher-order moments, buoyancy terms, and diagnose cloud fraction and liquid water. Since all the diagnosed moments for a given grid box and time step are derived from the same unique joint PDF, they are guaranteed to be consistent with one another. A companion paper presents simulations produced by the single-column model.},

@article{Bogenschutz2013,
	Abstract = {AbstractThis paper describes climate simulations of the Community Atmosphere Model, version 5 (CAM5), coupled with a higher-order turbulence closure known as Cloud Layers Unified by Binormals (CLUBB). CLUBB is a unified parameterization of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and shallow convection that is centered around a trivariate probability density function (PDF) and replaces the conventional PBL, shallow convection, and cloud macrophysics schemes in CAM5. CAM?CLUBB improves many aspects of the base state climate compared to CAM5. Chief among them is the transition of stratocumulus to trade wind cumulus regions in the subtropical oceans. In these regions, CAM?CLUBB provides a much more gradual transition that is in better agreement with observational analysis compared to CAM5, which is too abrupt. The improvement seen in CAM?CLUBB can be largely attributed to the gradual evolution of the simulated turbulence, which is in part a result of the unified nature of the parameterization, and to the general improved representation of shallow cumulus clouds compared to CAM5. In addition, there are large differences in the representation and structure of marine boundary layer clouds between CAM?CLUBB and CAM5. CAM?CLUBB is also shown to be more robust, in terms of boundary layer clouds, to changes in vertical resolution for global simulations in a preliminary test.},

	Abstract = {Abstract The Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) is an open-source community facility for data assimilation education, research, and development. DART's ensemble data assimilation algorithms, careful software engineering, and diagnostic tools allow atmospheric scientists, oceanographers, hydrologists, chemists, and other geophysicists to build state-of-the-art data assimilation systems with unprecedented ease. For global numerical weather prediction, DART produces ensemble-mean analyses comparable to analyses from major centers while also providing initial conditions for ensemble predictions. In addition, DART supports more novel assimilation applications like parameter estimation, sensitivity analysis, observing system design, and smoothing. Implementing basic systems for large models requires only a few person-weeks; comprehensive systems have been built in a few months. Incorporating new observation types is also straightforward, requiring only a forward operator mapping between a model's state and an observation's expected value. Forward operators for standard, in situ observations and novel types, like GPS radio occultation soundings, are available. DART algorithms scale well on a variety of parallel architectures, allowing large data assimilation problems to be studied. DART also includes many low-order models and an ensemble assimilation tutorial appropriate for undergraduate and graduate instruction.},

@article{Magnusson2014Sandy,
	Abstract = {AbstractOn 30 October 2012 Hurricane Sandy made landfall on the U.S. East Coast with a devastating impact. Here the performance of the ECMWF forecasts (both high resolution and ensemble) are evaluated together with ensemble forecasts from other numerical weather prediction centers, available from The Observing System Research and Predictability Experiment (THORPEX) Interactive Grand Global Ensemble (TIGGE) archive. The sensitivity to sea surface temperature (SST) and model resolution for the ECMWF forecasts are explored. The results show that the ECMWF forecasts provided a clear indication of the landfall from 7 days in advance. Comparing ensemble forecasts from different centers, the authors find the ensemble forecasts from ECMWF to be the most consistent in the forecast of the landfall of Sandy on the New Jersey coastline. The impact of the warm SST anomaly off the U.S. East Coast is investigated by running sensitivity experiments with climatological SST instead of persisting the SST anomaly from the analysis. The results show that the SST anomaly had a small effect on Sandy?s track in the forecast, but the forecasts initialized with the warm SST anomaly feature a more intense system in terms of the depth of the cyclone, wind speeds, and precipitation. Furthermore, the role of spatial resolution is investigated by comparing four global simulations, spanning from TL159 (150 km) to TL3999 (5 km) horizontal resolution. Forecasts from 3 and 5 days before the landfall are evaluated. While all resolutions predict Sandy?s landfall, at very high resolution the tropical cyclone intensity and the oceanic wave forecasts are greatly improved.},

@article{Torn2015Sandy,
	Abstract = {AbstractMedium-range forecasts of Hurricane Sandy?s track were characterized by widely diverging solutions, with some suggesting that Sandy would make landfall over the mid-Atlantic region of the United States, while others forecast the storm to move due east to the north of Bermuda. Here, dynamical processes responsible for the eastward-tracking forecasts are diagnosed using an 80-member ensemble of experimental Global Forecast System (GFS) forecasts initialized five days prior to landfall. Comparing the ensemble members with tracks to the east against those with tracks to the west indicates that the eastern members were characterized by a lower-amplitude upper-tropospheric anticyclone on the poleward side of Sandy during the first 24 h of the forecast, which in turn was associated with a westerly perturbation steering wind. The amplification of this ridge in each set of members was modulated by differences in the advection of potential vorticity (PV) by the irrotational wind associated with Sandy?s secondary circulation and isentropic lift along a warm front that formed on the poleward side of Sandy. The amplitude of the irrotational wind in this region was proportional to the 0-h water vapor mixing ratio, and to a lesser extent the 0-h upper-tropospheric horizontal divergence. These two quantities modulated the vertical profile of grid-scale condensation within the model and subsequent upper-tropospheric divergence. The results from this study suggest that additional observations within regions of large-scale precipitation outside the tropical cyclone (TC) core could benefit TC track forecasts, particularly when the TC is located near an upper-tropospheric PV gradient.},

@article{OSTIA2012SSTs,
	Abstract = {This paper describes a new Sea surface temperature (SST) analysis that is produced with global coverage on a daily basis at the Met Office called the Operational SST and Sea Ice Analysis (OSTIA) system. OSTIA uses satellite SST data provided by international agencies via the Group for High Resolution SST (GHRSST) Regional/Global Task Sharing (R/GTS) framework. GHRSST products include data from microwave and infrared satellite instruments with accompanying uncertainty estimates. The system also uses in situ SST data available over the Global Telecommunications System (GTS) and a sea-ice concentration product from the EUMETSAT Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Applications Facility (OSI-SAF). The SST analysis is a multi-scale optimal interpolation that is designed for applications in numerical weather prediction and ocean forecasting systems. The background error covariance matrix is specified using ocean model data and the analysis uses correlation length scales of 10 km and 100 km. The OSTIA system produces a foundation SST estimate (SSTfnd, which is the SST free of diurnal variability) at an output grid resolution of 1/20? ({\texttt{\char126}} 6 km) although the smallest analysis feature resolution is based on the correlation length scale of 10 km. All satellite SST data are adjusted for bias errors based on a combination of ENVISAT Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) SST data and in situ SST measurements from drifting buoys. Data are filtered (based on surface wind speed data) to remove diurnal variability and AATSR data are adjusted to represent the SST at the same depth as drifting buoy measurements (0.2?1 m) before bias adjustments are made. Global coverage outputs are provided each day in GHRSST L4 netCDF format. A variety of secondary products are also provided including weekly and monthly mean data sets. OSTIA products are continuously monitored and validation/verification activities demonstrate that SST products have zero mean bias and an accuracy of {\texttt{\char126}} 0.57 K compared to in situ measurements. OSTIA is now used operationally as a boundary condition for all weather forecast models at the Met Office and at European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF). OSTIA is produced by the Met Office as part of the European Union Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) MyOcean project.},

@article{Jin2013COAMPS,
	Abstract = {AbstractA series of experiments have been conducted using the Coupled Ocean?Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System?Tropical Cyclone (COAMPS-TC) to assess the impact of horizontal resolution on hurricane intensity prediction for 10 Atlantic storms during the 2005 and 2007 hurricane seasons. The results of this study from the Hurricane Katrina (2005) simulations indicate that the hurricane intensity and structure are very sensitive to the horizontal grid spacing (9 and 3 km) and underscore the need for cloud microphysics to capture the structure, especially for strong storms with small-diameter eyes and large pressure gradients. The high resolution simulates stronger vertical motions, a more distinct upper-level warm core, stronger upper-level outflow, and greater finescale structure associated with deep convection, including spiral rainbands and the secondary circulation. A vortex Rossby wave (VRW) spectrum analysis is performed on the simulated 10-m winds and the NOAA/Hurricane Research Division (HRD) Real-Time Hurricane Wind Analysis System (H*Wind) to evaluate the impact of horizontal resolution. The degree to which the VRWs are adequately resolved near the TC inner core is addressed and the associated resolvable wave energy is explored at different grid resolutions. The fine resolution is necessary to resolve higher-wavenumber modes of VRWs to preserve more wave energy and, hence, to attain a more detailed eyewall structure. The wind?pressure relationship from the high-resolution simulations is in better agreement with the observations than are the coarse-resolution simulations for the strong storms. Two case studies are analyzed and overall the statistical analyses indicate that high resolution is beneficial for TC intensity and structure forecasts, while it has little impact on track forecasts.},

	Abstract = {Abstract The representation of tropical cyclone track, intensity, and structure in a set of 69 parallel forecasts performed at each of two horizontal grid increments with the Advanced Research Hurricane (AHW) component of the Weather and Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) is evaluated. These forecasts covered 10 Atlantic tropical cyclones: 6 from the 2005 season and 4 from 2007. The forecasts were integrated from identical initial conditions produced by a cycling ensemble Kalman filter. The high-resolution forecasts used moving, storm-centered nests of 4- and 1.33-km grid spacing. The coarse-resolution forecasts consisted of a single 12-km domain (which was identical to the outer domain in the forecasts with nests). Forecasts were evaluated out to 120 h. Novel verification techniques were developed to evaluate forecasts of wind radii and the degree of storm asymmetry. Intensity (maximum wind) and rapid intensification, as well as wind radii, were all predicted more accurately with increased horizontal resolution. These results were deemed to be statistically significant based on the application of bootstrap confidence intervals. No statistically significant differences emerged regarding storm position errors between the two forecasts. Coarse-resolution forecasts tended to overpredict the extent of winds compared to high-resolution forecasts. The asymmetry of gale-force winds was better predicted in the coarser-resolution simulation, but asymmetry of hurricane-force winds was predicted better at high resolution. The skill of the wind radii forecasts decayed gradually over 120 h, suggesting a synoptic-scale control of the predictability of outer winds.},

	Abstract = {AbstractThe following study examines the position and intensity differences of tropical cyclones (TCs) among the Best-Track and five atmospheric reanalysis datasets to evaluate the degree to which reanalyses are appropriate for studying TCs. While significant differences are found in both reanalysis TC intensity and position, the representation of TC intensity within reanalyses is found to be most problematic owing to its underestimation beyond what can be attributed solely to the coarse grid resolution. Moreover, the mean life cycle of normalized TC intensity within reanalyses reveals an underestimation of both prepeak intensification rates as well as a delay in peak intensity relative to the Best-Track. These discrepancies between Best-Track and reanalysis TC intensity and position can further be described through correlations with such parameters as Best-Track TC age, Best-Track TC intensity, Best-Track TC location, and the extended Best-Track TC size. Specifically, TC position differences within the 40-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA-40), ECMWF Interim Re-Analysis (ERA-I), and Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) exhibit statistically significant correlations (0.27 ≤R ≤0.38) with the proximity of TCs to observation dense areas in the North Atlantic (NATL) and western North Pacific (WPAC). Reanalysis TC intensity is found to be most strongly correlated with Best-Track TC size (0.53 ≤R ≤0.70 for maximum 10-m wind speed; ?0.71 ≤R ≤?0.53 for minimum mean sea level pressure) while exhibiting smaller, yet significant, correlations with Best-Track TC age, Best-Track TC intensity, and Best-Track TC latitude. Of the three basins examined, the eastern North Pacific (EPAC) has the largest reanalysis TC position differences and weakest intensities possibly due to a relative dearth of observations, the strong nearby terrain gradient, and the movement of TCs away from the most observation dense portion of the basin over time. The smaller mean Best-Track size and shorter mean lifespan of Best-Track EPAC TCs may also yield weaker reanalysis TC intensities. Of the five reanalyses, the smaller position differences and stronger intensities found in the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) and Japanese 25-year Reanalysis (JRA-25) are attributed to the use of vortex relocation and TC wind profile retrievals, respectively. The discrepancies in TC position between the Best-Track and reanalyses combined with the muted magnitude of TC intensity and its partially nonphysical life cycle within reanalyses suggests that caution should be exercised when utilizing these datasets for studies that rely either on TC intensity (raw or normalized) or track. Finally, several cases of nonphysical TC structure also argue that further work is needed to improve TC representation while implying that studies focusing solely on TC intensity and track do not necessarily extend to other aspects of TC representation.},

	Abstract = {Abstract While internal climate variability is known to affect climate projections, its influence is often underappreciated and confused with model error. Why? In general, modeling centers contribute a small number of realizations to international climate model assessments (e.g., Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5)). As a result, model error and internal climate variability are difficult, and at times impossible, to disentangle. In response, the Community Earth System Model (CESM) community designed the CESM Large Ensemble (CESM-LE) with the explicit goal of enabling assessment of climate change in the presence of internal climate variability. All CESM-LE simulations use a single CMIP5 model (CESM with the Community Atmosphere Model version 5). The core simulations replay the 20?21st century (1920?2100) 30 times under historical and Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 external forcing with small initial condition differences. Two companion 1000+-year long pre-industrial control simulations (fully coupled, prognostic atmosphere and land only) allow assessment of internal climate variability in the absence of climate change. Comprehensive outputs, including many daily fields, are available as single-variable time series on the Earth System Grid for anyone to use. Early results demonstrate the substantial influence of internal climate variability on 20th?21st century climate trajectories. Global warming hiatus decades occur, similar to those recently observed. Internal climate variability alone can produce projection spread comparable to that in CMIP5. Scientists and stakeholders can use CESM-LE outputs to help interpret the observational record, to understand projection spread, and to plan for a range of possible futures influenced by both internal climate variability and forced climate change. Capsule: ?By simulating climate trajectories over the period 1920?2100 multiple times with small atmospheric initialization differences but using the same model and external forcing, this community project provides a comprehensive resource for studying climate change in the presence of internal climate variability.?},

	Abstract = {Abstract Spurious high-frequency oscillations occur in forecasts made with the primitive equations if the initial fields of mass and wind are not in an appropriate state of balance with each other. These oscillations are due to gravity-inertia waves of unrealistically large amplitude; the primary purpose of initialization is the removal or reduction of this high-frequency noise by a delicate adjustment of the analyzed data. In this paper a simple method of eliminating spurious oscillations is presented. The method uses a digital filter applied to time series of the model variables generated by short-range forward and backward integrations from the initial time. The digital filtering technique is applied to initialize data for the High-Resolution Limited-Area Model (HIRLAM). The method is shown to have the three characteristics essential to any satisfactory initialization scheme: (i) high-frequency noise is effectively removed from the forecast; (ii) changes made to the analyzed fields are acceptably small; (iii) the forecast is not degraded by application of the initialization. The digital filtering initialization (DFI) technique is compared to the standard nonlinear normal-mode initialization (NMI) used with the HIRLAM model. Both methods yield comparable results, though the filtering appears more effective in suppressing noise in the early forecast hours. The computation time required for initialization is about the same for DFI and NMI. The outstanding appeal of the digital filtering technique is its great simplicity in conception and application.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Tropical cyclone track forecasting has improved recently to the point at which extending the official forecasts of both track and intensity to 5 days is being considered at the National Hurricane Center and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. Current verification procedures at both of these operational centers utilize a suite of control models, derived from the ?climatology? and ?persistence? techniques, that make forecasts out to 3 days. To evaluate and verify 5-day forecasts, the current suite of control forecasts needs to be redeveloped to extend the forecasts from 72 to 120 h. This paper describes the development of 5-day tropical cyclone intensity forecast models derived from climatology and persistence for the Atlantic, the eastern North Pacific, and the western North Pacific Oceans. Results using independent input data show that these new models possess similar error and bias characteristics when compared with their predecessors in the North Atlantic and eastern North Pacific but that the west Pacific model shows a statistically significant improvement when compared with its forerunner. Errors associated with these tropical cyclone intensity forecast models are also shown to level off beyond 3 days in all of the basins studied.},

Changes to the model involve the inclusion of more accurate historical tropical cyclone track data and a simpler derivation of the regression equations. Nonlinear systems analysis shows that the predictability timescale in which the average errors increase by a factor e is approximately 2.5 days in the Atlantic basin, which is larger than that found by similar methods near Australia. This suggests that 5-day tropical cyclone track forecasts may have some benefit, and therefore a version of CLIPER extended to 5 days to be used as a baseline to measure this skill is needed.},

@article{Dai2006,
	Abstract = {Abstract Monthly and 3-hourly precipitation data from twentieth-century climate simulations by the newest generation of 18 coupled climate system models are analyzed and compared with available observations. The characteristics examined include the mean spatial patterns, intraseasonal-to-interannual and ENSO-related variability, convective versus stratiform precipitation ratio, precipitation frequency and intensity for different precipitation categories, and diurnal cycle. Although most models reproduce the observed broad patterns of precipitation amount and year-to-year variability, models without flux corrections still show an unrealistic double-ITCZ pattern over the tropical Pacific, whereas the flux-corrected models, especially the Meteorological Research Institute (MRI) Coupled Global Climate Model (CGCM; version 2.3.2a), produce realistic rainfall patterns at low latitudes. As in previous generations of coupled models, the rainfall double ITCZs are related to westward expansion of the cold tongue of sea surface temperature (SST) that is observed only over the equatorial eastern Pacific but extends to the central Pacific in the models. The partitioning of the total variance of precipitation among intraseasonal, seasonal, and longer time scales is generally reproduced by the models, except over the western Pacific where the models fail to capture the large intraseasonal variations. Most models produce too much convective (over 95{\%} of total precipitation) and too little stratiform precipitation over most of the low latitudes, in contrast to 45{\%}?65{\%} in convective form in the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite observations. The biases in the convective versus stratiform precipitation ratio are linked to the unrealistically strong coupling of tropical convection to local SST, which results in a positive correlation between the standard deviation of Ni{\~n}o-3.4 SST and the local convective-to-total precipitation ratio among the models. The models reproduce the percentage of the contribution (to total precipitation) and frequency for moderate precipitation (10?20 mm day?1), but underestimate the contribution and frequency for heavy (>20 mm day?1) and overestimate them for light (<10 mm day?1) precipitation. The newest generation of coupled models still rains too frequently, mostly within the 1?10 mm day?1 category. Precipitation intensity over the storm tracks around the eastern coasts of Asia and North America is comparable to that in the ITCZ (10?12 mm day?1) in the TRMM data, but it is much weaker in the models. The diurnal analysis suggests that warm-season convection still starts too early in these new models and occurs too frequently at reduced intensity in some of the models. The results show that considerable improvements in precipitation simulations are still desirable for the latest generation of the world?s coupled climate models.},

@article{Gall2012HFIP,
	Abstract = {Over the decade prior to 2007, the increasing vulnerability of the United States to damage and economic disruption from tropical storms and hurricanes was dramatically demonstrated by the impacts of a number of land-falling storms. In 2008, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) established the Hurricane Forecast Improvement Project (HFIP) to significantly increase the agency's capability to address this vulnerability and begin to mitigate the impacts. In fiscal year 2009, The White House amended the president's budget and Congress appropriated funding to achieve a 20{\%} reduction in forecast error (track and intensity) in 5 years with 50{\%} reduction in 10 years. Over the past 3 years, HFIP has built computational infrastructure and implemented a focused set of cross-organizational research and development (R\&D) activities to develop, demonstrate, and implement enhanced operational modeling capabilities to improve the numerical forecast guidance made available to the National Hurricane Center (NHC). HFIP collaborators, including federal laboratories and academic partners, have demonstrated potential for dramatic improvements in both hurricane track and intensity (up to 40{\%}) prediction through the application of new techniques, including improved data assimilation, higher-resolution models (global and regional), enhanced model physics, better use of existing data sources to initialize regional hurricane models, and new postprocessing techniques. During each hurricane season, HFIP will run an experimental forecast system on NOAA's R\&D high-performance computing to provide experimental improved guidance to NHC forecasters. Prior to each season, NHC will review and select a set of enhanced guidance products to evaluate operationally during the season (mid-July?October).},

@article{Tallapragada2013,
	Abstract = {AbstractIn this work, a high-resolution triple-nested implementation of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) operational Hurricane Weather Research and Forecast (HWRF) model for the 2012 hurricane season is evaluated. Statistics of retrospective experiments for 2010-2011 hurricane seasons show that the new configuration demonstrates significant improvement as compared to the 2011 operational HWRF in terms of storm track, intensity, size, dynamical constraints between mass and wind field and initial vortex imbalance. Specifically, the 5-day track and intensify forecast errors are improved by about 19{\%} and 7{\%} for the North Atlantic basin, and by 9{\%} and 30{\%} for the Eastern Pacific basin, respectively. Verifications of storm size in terms of wind radii at 34-kt, 50-kt, and 64-kt thresholds at different quadrants show dramatic improvement with most of the overestimation of the storm size in previous operational HWRF versions removed at all forecast times. In addition, dynamical constraints between the storm intensity and the outermost radius in the new configuration are consistent with the best track data. Relationship between minimum sea level pressure and maximum 10-m wind is also improved in both basins, indicating that the storm dynamics and structure have been improved in the 2012 HWRF as compared to the previous versions. These significant improvements obtained with the new HWRF implementation are attributed to a number of major changes including a new higher resolution nest, improved vortex initialization, improved planetary boundary layer and turbulence physics and some critical bug fixes related to the moving nest. Such improvements show that the new HWRF implementation is a promising upgrade for future hurricane seasons.},

@article{Craig2012,
	Abstract = {The Community Climate System Model (CCSM) has been developed over the last decade, and it is used to understand past, present, and future climates. The latest versions of the model, CCSM4 and CESM1, contain totally new coupling capabilities in the CPL7 coupler that permit additional flexibility and extensibility to address the challenges involved in earth system modeling. The CPL7 coupling architecture takes a completely new approach with respect to the high-level design of the system. CCSM4 now contains a top-level driver that calls model component initialize, run, and finalize methods through specified interfaces. The top-level driver allows the model components to be placed on relatively arbitrary hardware processor layouts and run sequentially, concurrently, or mixed. Improvements have been made to the memory and performance scaling of the coupler to support much higher resolution configurations. CCSM4 scales better to higher processor counts, and has the ability to handle global resolutions up to one-tenth of a degree.},

	Abstract = {Recent coordinated efforts, in which numerous climate models have been run for a common set of experiments, have produced large datasets of projections of future climate for various scenarios. Those multi-model ensembles sample initial condition, parameter as well as structural uncertainties in the model design, and they have prompted a variety of approaches to quantify uncertainty in future climate in a probabilistic way. This paper outlines the motivation for using multi-model ensembles, reviews the methodologies published so far and compares their results for regional temperature projections. The challenges in interpreting multi-model results, caused by the lack of verification of climate projections, the problem of model dependence, bias and tuning as well as the difficulty in making sense of an `ensemble of opportunity', are discussed in detail.},
