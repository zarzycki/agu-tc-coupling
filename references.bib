@article{Camargo2013CMIP,
	Abstract = {AbstractTropical cyclone (TC) activity is analyzed in
                   14 models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model
                   Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). The global TC
                   activity in the historical runs is compared with
                   observations. The simulation of TC activity in the
                   CMIP5 models is not as good as in higher-resolution
                   simulations. The CMIP5 global TC frequency is much
                   lower than observed, and there is significant
                   deficiency in the geographical patterns of TC tracks
                   and formation. Although all of the models
                   underestimate the global frequency of TCs, the models
                   present a wide range of global TC frequency. The
                   models with the highest horizontal resolution have
                   the highest level of global TC activity, though
                   resolution is not the only factor that determines
                   model TC activity. A cold SST bias could potentially
                   contribute to the low number of TCs in the models.
                   The models show no consensus regarding the difference
                   of TC activity in two warming scenarios
                   {$[$}representative concentration pathway 4.5
                   (RCP4.5) and RCP8.5{$]$} and the historical
                   simulation. The author examined in more detail North
                   Atlantic and eastern North Pacific TC activity in a
                   subset of models and found no robust changes across
                   models in TC frequency. Therefore, there is no robust
                   signal across the CMIP5 models in global and regional
                   TC changes in activity for future scenarios. The
                   future changes in various large-scale environmental
                   fields associated with TC activity were also examined
                   globally: genesis potential index, potential
                   intensity, vertical wind shear, and sea level
                   pressure. The multimodel mean changes of these
                   variables in the CMIP5 models are consistent with the
                   changes obtained in the CMIP3 models.},

@article{Walsh2015CLIVAR,
	Abstract = {Abstract While a quantitative climate theory of
                   tropical cyclone formation remains elusive,
                   considerable progress has been made recently in our
                   ability to simulate tropical cyclone climatologies
                   and understand the relationship between climate and
                   tropical cyclone formation. Climate models are now
                   able to simulate a realistic rate of global tropical
                   cyclone formation, although simulation of the
                   Atlantic tropical cyclone climatology remains
                   challenging unless horizontal resolutions finer than
                   50 km are employed. This article summarizes published
                   research from the idealized experiments of the
                   Hurricane Working Group of U.S. CLIVAR (CLImate
                   VARiability and predictability of the
                   ocean-atmosphere system). This work, combined with
                   results from other model simulations, has
                   strengthened relationships between tropical cyclone
                   formation rates and climate variables such as
                   mid-tropospheric vertical velocity, with decreased
                   climatological vertical velocities leading to
                   decreased tropical cyclone formation. Systematic
                   differences are shown between experiments in which
                   only sea surface temperature is increased versus
                   experiments where only atmospheric carbon dioxide is
                   increased, with the carbon dioxide experiments more
                   likely to demonstrate the decrease in tropical
                   cyclone numbers previously shown to be a common
                   response of climate models in a warmer climate.
                   Experiments where the two effects are combined also
                   show decreases in numbers, but these tend to be less
                   for models that demonstrate a strong tropical cyclone
                   response to increased sea surface temperatures.
                   Further experiments are proposed that may improve our
                   understanding of the relationship between climate and
                   tropical cyclone formation, including experiments
                   with two-way interaction between the ocean and the
                   atmosphere and variations in atmospheric aerosols.},

	Abstract = {AbstractThe sensitivity of tropical cyclones (TCs) to
                   changes in parameterized convection is investigated
                   to improve the simulation of TCs in the North
                   Atlantic. Specifically, the impact of reducing the
                   influence of the Relaxed Arakawa?Schubert (RAS)
                   scheme-based parameterized convection is explored
                   using the Goddard Earth Observing System version 5
                   (GEOS-5) model at 0.25$\,^{\circ}$horizontal grid
                   spacing. The years 2005 and 2006, characterized by
                   very active and inactive hurricane seasons,
                   respectively, are selected for simulation.A reduction
                   in parameterized deep convection results in an
                   increase in TC activity (e.g., TC number and longer
                   life cycle) to more realistic levels compared to the
                   baseline control configuration. The vertical and
                   horizontal structure of the strongest simulated
                   hurricane shows the maximum wind speed greater than
                   60 m s?1 and the minimum sea level pressure reaching
                   \~{}940 mb, which are never achieved by the control
                   configuration. The radius of the maximum wind of
                   \~{}50 km, the location of the warm core exceeding
                   10$\,^{\circ}$C, and the horizontal compactness of
                   the hurricane center are all quite realistic without
                   any negatively affecting the atmospheric mean
                   state.This study reveals that an increase in the
                   threshold of minimum entrainment suppresses
                   parameterized deep convection by entraining more dry
                   air into the typical plume. This leads to cooling and
                   drying at the mid to upper troposphere, along with
                   the positive latent heat flux and moistening in the
                   lower troposphere. The resulting increase in
                   conditional instability provides an environment that
                   is more conducive to TC vortex development and upward
                   moisture flux convergence by dynamically resolved
                   moist convection, thereby increasing TC activity.},

@article{Craig2012,
	Abstract = {The Community Climate System Model (CCSM) has been
                   developed over the last decade, and it is used to
                   understand past, present, and future climates. The
                   latest versions of the model, CCSM4 and CESM1,
                   contain totally new coupling capabilities in the CPL7
                   coupler that permit additional flexibility and
                   extensibility to address the challenges involved in
                   earth system modeling. The CPL7 coupling architecture
                   takes a completely new approach with respect to the
                   high-level design of the system. CCSM4 now contains a
                   top-level driver that calls model component
                   initialize, run, and finalize methods through
                   specified interfaces. The top-level driver allows the
                   model components to be placed on relatively arbitrary
                   hardware processor layouts and run sequentially,
                   concurrently, or mixed. Improvements have been made
                   to the memory and performance scaling of the coupler
                   to support much higher resolution configurations.
                   CCSM4 scales better to higher processor counts, and
                   has the ability to handle global resolutions up to
                   one-tenth of a degree.},
