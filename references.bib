@article{Walsh2015CLIVAR,
	Abstract = {Abstract While a quantitative climate theory of tropical cyclone formation remains elusive, considerable progress has been made recently in our ability to simulate tropical cyclone climatologies and understand the relationship between climate and tropical cyclone formation. Climate models are now able to simulate a realistic rate of global tropical cyclone formation, although simulation of the Atlantic tropical cyclone climatology remains challenging unless horizontal resolutions finer than 50 km are employed. This article summarizes published research from the idealized experiments of the Hurricane Working Group of U.S. CLIVAR (CLImate VARiability and predictability of the ocean-atmosphere system). This work, combined with results from other model simulations, has strengthened relationships between tropical cyclone formation rates and climate variables such as mid-tropospheric vertical velocity, with decreased climatological vertical velocities leading to decreased tropical cyclone formation. Systematic differences are shown between experiments in which only sea surface temperature is increased versus experiments where only atmospheric carbon dioxide is increased, with the carbon dioxide experiments more likely to demonstrate the decrease in tropical cyclone numbers previously shown to be a common response of climate models in a warmer climate. Experiments where the two effects are combined also show decreases in numbers, but these tend to be less for models that demonstrate a strong tropical cyclone response to increased sea surface temperatures. Further experiments are proposed that may improve our understanding of the relationship between climate and tropical cyclone formation, including experiments with two-way interaction between the ocean and the atmosphere and variations in atmospheric aerosols.},

@article{Hurrell2013CESM,
	Abstract = {The Community Earth System Model (CESM) is a flexible and extensible community tool used to investigate a diverse set of Earth system interactions across multiple time and space scales. This global coupled model significantly extends its predecessor, the Community Climate System Model, by incorporating new Earth system simulation capabilities. These comprise the ability to simulate biogeochemical cycles, including those of carbon and nitrogen, a variety of atmospheric chemistry options, the Greenland Ice Sheet, and an atmosphere that extends to the lower thermosphere. These and other new model capabilities are enabling investigations into a wide range of pressing scientific questions, providing new foresight into possible future climates and increasing our collective knowledge about the behavior and interactions of the Earth system. Simulations with numerous configurations of the CESM have been provided to phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) and are being analyzed by the broad community of scientists. Additionally, the model source code and associated documentation are freely available to the scientific community to use for Earth system studies, making it a true community tool. This article describes this Earth system model and its various possible configurations, and highlights a number of its scientific capabilities.},

@article{Lim2014TCconv,
	Abstract = {AbstractThe sensitivity of tropical cyclones (TCs) to
                   changes in parameterized convection is investigated
                   to improve the simulation of TCs in the North
                   Atlantic. Specifically, the impact of reducing the
                   influence of the Relaxed Arakawa?Schubert (RAS)
                   scheme-based parameterized convection is explored
                   using the Goddard Earth Observing System version 5
                   (GEOS-5) model at 0.25$\,^{\circ}$horizontal grid
                   spacing. The years 2005 and 2006, characterized by
                   very active and inactive hurricane seasons,
                   respectively, are selected for simulation.A reduction
                   in parameterized deep convection results in an
                   increase in TC activity (e.g., TC number and longer
                   life cycle) to more realistic levels compared to the
                   baseline control configuration. The vertical and
                   horizontal structure of the strongest simulated
                   hurricane shows the maximum wind speed greater than
                   60 m s?1 and the minimum sea level pressure reaching
                   \~{}940 mb, which are never achieved by the control
                   configuration. The radius of the maximum wind of
                   \~{}50 km, the location of the warm core exceeding
                   10$\,^{\circ}$C, and the horizontal compactness of
                   the hurricane center are all quite realistic without
                   any negatively affecting the atmospheric mean
                   state.This study reveals that an increase in the
                   threshold of minimum entrainment suppresses
                   parameterized deep convection by entraining more dry
                   air into the typical plume. This leads to cooling and
                   drying at the mid to upper troposphere, along with
                   the positive latent heat flux and moistening in the
                   lower troposphere. The resulting increase in
                   conditional instability provides an environment that
                   is more conducive to TC vortex development and upward
                   moisture flux convergence by dynamically resolved
                   moist convection, thereby increasing TC activity.},
